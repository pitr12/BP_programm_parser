This film follows up on the story of the three boys, called the West Memphis Three, who were convicted for this crime with questionable evidence. For years, the boys' fate sparked a mass movement striving to prove their innocence while the state is equally determined to avoid admitting it could have been wrong. Through the swirl of new evidence and suspects, the Three tell their own tale about enduring this injustice against the opinions of the victim's families in a debate that eventually came to an inadequate resolution.

A single hippopotamus holds a pride of twelve lions at bay with his sheer bulk, but backs down when faced with the piercing teeth of another hippo. With lethal weapons wielded by fearsome predators and prey, animals walk a precarious path, here among Africa's Deadliest.                 Parker",

Each animal has different strengths, even some weaknesses, but seeing them in action is always impressive.

Cruel and crude attempts to 'cure' him poisoned their relationship and helped turn the boy, born to unite the Royal families of Britain and Germany, into the man who tore them apart. Featuring a long-hidden cache of intimate family letters, this documentary reveals this secret story of child cruelty, secret shame and dark, incestuous desires, which begins behind palace doors and ends in the carnage of World War I.

Why is blue liquid used in advertisements for sanitary napkins? Is the pill being used to adjust our body's rhythm to that of a male-dominated society?

With potent images and illuminating insights from thinkers who have probed our genes, our brains, and our social behaviour, this requiem to progress-as-usual also poses a challenge: to prove that making apes smarter isn't an evolutionary dead-end.

Sub B-59 was out of touch with the Kremlin, and was also too deep to hear any radio, so the sub's officers did not know if war was underway or not. B-59's captain and its political commissar both wanted to launch a torpedo.                 Stevens",

Muddy, whose health was declining, dying 1 ½ years later, is sitting down, playing a rather desultory set when the Rolling Stones finally lurch into the club. This seems to fire up Muddy who plays standing up the rest of the show, but needs to urge the Stones, who idolized Muddy, to join him. One by one they do. Muddy beseeches Mick Jagger, who seems the drunkest of the Stones, coming up last to sing with Muddy on several tunes. Guitarist Buddy Guy, who was an owner of the club, joins the group, along with harpist Junior Wells and a fiery Lefty Dizz. The Stones were playing in Rosemont, Illinois on the Tattoo You tour, and this was their night off. The film of the set appeared immediately on bootlegs, but was not issued on DVD until 2012.                 Stevens",

Sailing inside the pirate-infested swath of sea between Somalia and Yemen, the ship's captain blinks hard at the radar screen where a light begins to flash. This is it, Nozhkin thinks, and he's right. Machine guns sound on the boat's hull and for two months this 13-man crew will be held at the mercy of Somali pirates, helpless as hostage negotiations threaten their lives and cameras capture every move. The pirates' translator, Ishmael Ali, a single dad who may or may not have stumbled into this controversial role, puts in a call to the shipping magnate's CEO Per Gullestrup demanding an exorbitant 7 million dollars. The shipowner's response is the first of many misfires and communications to come. These two adversaries will have to become unlikely ...                ",
